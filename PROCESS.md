- Subject and backup subject are not sufficient, had to choose new subject
- Visited worldbank data repository for inspiration, new subject is the connection between the state of a country (development, political situation) and how many arms it exports/imports
  - This works better because it can be visualized better
  - Enough data to feed 3 interactive connected views
